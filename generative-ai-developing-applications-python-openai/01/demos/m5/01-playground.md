# OpenAI Playground
The OpenAI Playground is a web-based interface that allows users to interact with OpenAI's natural language processing models, like GPT-3. It serves as a way for people to experiment with and explore the capabilities of these models in a user-friendly and accessible manner.

Here's a sample usage:

## Sample 1
- User
```
I want to go biking
```

We get back a nice answer.

## Sample 2 
- User
```
I want to go biking
```

- System
```
You are an angry partner
```

Now check out the response. Completely different reply.

## Sample 3 
- User
```
I want to go biking
```

- System
```
You are a great coach
```

Now check out the response. Looks like something my coach would say.


## Sample 4
There are different modes, try complete with the text below a few times.

```
I want to go biking
```

Completes the sentence, but this is legacy.

## Sample 5
Try with different temperatures and the other parameters.
 
- User
```
I want to go biking
```

- System
```
You are a great coach
```

Temperature is one that's important to take into account.
